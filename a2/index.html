			<h2>Subtheme: Speculation</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Question 1: How have investments in different submarkets changed over time, and do the decisions and investments in different submarkets have measurable impact on eachother? 
					<ul>
						<li> Motivation: Coming from a suburb of Los Angeles, I am curious on how activities within a city impact surrounding areas, and vice versa. The reading also inspired this question as I noticed the information on different investment behavior per submarket, and how trends changed over time. This image inspired me to explore the interconnectedness between dense and sparse housing areas, figure 11 in the article Homes for Profit. </li>

					</ul>

				</li>
				<li>Question 2: Do new properties actually draw in more affordable housing options, or are new builds targetted equally by investors and result in an increase in aggregate housing cost metrics?
					<ul>
						<li> Motivation: When looking at flipping information displayed in the article, I am curious how people decide on what houses to flip or purchase as an investment. How can we then use this information in order to build more sustainable housing options that can be utilized as actual home users instead of absentee owners. As someone who lives in a suburb, I would love to know how flippers decide on houses, and how new builds impact flipping behavior. </li>

					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Question 3: Which neighborhoods and submarkets are most targeted by investors, and how does this activity impact affordability or displacement risk? Do investments and corporate buyers improve living conditions of subgroups of people?
					<ul>
						<li> Motivation: I would like to better understand the demographics of Boston neighborhoods, and how that can explain investor and flipping behavior. From the article, “Table 3. Description of the residential density and housing characteristics of MAPC’s seven housing submarkets and the people who live in them” lists many interesting demographic information about each submarket. I would like to explore how submarket populations can benefit or be harmed through specific investment and/or coroporate behaviors. </li>
