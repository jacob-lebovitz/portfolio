				Insights about the data/visualization:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>This visualization is showing the 7-day average of new Covid-19 cases starting in 2020 and going to 2022.</li>
				<li>Throughout the year 2020, the 7-day average seems to steadily increase over time, shown in the graph by the wider distance between the red and black line. In the start of 2021, there is a peak, followed by a steady decrease throughout the summer until July. This trough is followed by another mild increase throughout October and December of 2021. In 2022, there is a large peak in the data, which actually seems to be a projection for the next month. </li>
				<li>There seems to be a slight wave pattern in the data, with troughs followed by peaks. Winter months on average have a higher 7-day new case value, with troughs coming more in summer months. </li>
				<li>January 2022 has the largest new case average by far compared to the other data available. </li>
			</ul>

				Design Critique:

			<p>
				The spiral graph depicting 7-day new Covid-19 cases communicates a somewhat clear message with the audience, while unnecessarily obstructing information in ineffective encodings. Expressive encodings are heavily used in the structure and design choices of the visualization. Constructing time as a spiral line was a decision of expressive encoding, which somewhat effectively controls how the eye moves about the graph. However, constructing time as a non-linear function and spatial having dates that are temporally far physically close together on the visualization can make it challenging to understand and derive trend insights. The spiral graphic gives an idea of continuity as compared to a static horizontal axis, possibly giving readers the sensation that this spiral will continue and this issue is not terminating. This continuity is reflected in the lack of a border at the end of the red region, emphasizing the perception that Jan. 2022 is just the end of the graph but the area is going to continue to rise. Additionally, encoding the data value as a width was another expressive encoding to show covid cases through an area/length measurement. Effective encoding is not too pronounced, but the placement of the end of the spiral at the top of the page draws your eyes toward January 2022, which also is the widest portion of the graph. Red coloring on the shading connotes negativity for US readers, associating covid case rises with a negative emotional response. The illustrator draws an eye to Jan. 2022 as the highlight of the graphic, disregarding the importance of potential trends in years prior, which was the main point of the article. The data is able to be seen over each year, so it is not necessarily hidden, but manipulating the axis makes it more challenging to understand trends. This decision highlights Jan. 2022 and hides trends, which while not necessarily deceptive, it is important to note. Additionally, the width of the scale going to 150k while Jan. 2022 looks to be larger than that width, making it challenging to gather actual data points from the graph.
				The target audience would be able to gather general trends, but they lack the ability to directly compare between specific dates. However, the typical audience for the New York Times is not interested in grabbing specific data; communicating general trends and highlighting upcoming increases in cases is far more important, which is a strength of the visualization. The audience can clearly see that January 2022 will have the largest new cases, which is the message throughout the piece. Each year is labeled to be at the start of January, and the month dividers are labeled. The width of the line is described to be the 7-day average in new cases, but maybe it is difficult to understand that the black line is an axis. The legend labels 0 and 150k cases, but does not communicate any other length values. The article describes 2022 to be a projection, but that is not labeled or communicated in the visualization. Consistent font sizes and colors make it easy to read dates and establish a hierarchy of importance to the labels. Most people will start reading the graph at the top and move down, only understanding the structure of the spiral after a first glance. This will take them back to the top, which is the key point of the visualization. I wish there was a specific graph title to connect Omicron cases with the cases shown in the graph.

			<h2>Visualization Sketches</h2>

				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I was hoping that this chart would be more of an illustration of the trends over time, giving readers a stronger feeling that their data was being communicated to them without deception or manipulation. Additionally, this style could differentiate past vs predicted values through different textures, still drawing the eye to the spike in 2022 but maintaining data transparency. </li>
				<li>I wish there was stronger contrast between past and future values, and less emphasis on the trends, which could have been done through less lines/points/specific callouts. </li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>With this chart, I was hoping to experiment with diluting the sense of time/change over time. This was done by still keeping it on the x-axis, but showing the change in cases through the size of a bubble. This shows less up and down nature, and uses area, which is less understandable and uses System 2 in the brain. By highlighting the Jan 2022 average with tecture and color, System 1 can recognzie that immediately and draw focus there instead of the trends before it. This worked well to illustrate an emphasis even more on Jan. 2022, but failed in the large amount of blank space and proportions of the overall graph. </li>
			</ul>

				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Further, I feel like throughout these sketches I startered going far away from the original sketch, and later worked my way back towards the original visualization. With the final, I tried to stick with the spiral design, but illustrate the dramatic increase in January through an area, scaled/stacked pie chart. This idea I think has potential as a way to garner a large impact for a specific portion of the trend. It makes it challenging to illustrate multiple years on this chart, so I shrunk the date range to be Jan 2021 - Jan 2022. As with the other plots, I tried to utilize texture to draw attention, and struggled with the labeling and format of overlapping dates. </li>

			<h2>Final Writeup</h2>

			<p>
        My final visualization is an area chart designed to immediately draw the viewer’s focus to the projected spike in new Covid-19 cases caused by the Omicron variant. The primary message I aim to tell is one of alertness and urgency regarding the future surge. By focusing exclusively on the new case count, which aligns with the goal of the original New York Times visualization, I wanted to demonstrate a clear link between the emergence of Omicron and the massive predicted spike in January 2022. To maintain industry accuracy and keep the projections reasonable, I intentionally removed the future data more than 4-to-6-weeks in the future, as recommended in the source article. This decision improved reliability through realistic forecasting, but also serves to isolate and amplify the January peak.
		To effectively communicate this message, I used several specific visual encodings and data transformations. I utilized an area chart rather than a standard line chart. The filled area physically takes up more space on the page, giving the volume of cases a heavier, more impactful visual feeling. I implemented a dual color-texture encoding: a muted, solid grey for historical data and a brighter, red-striped texture for future predictions. This stark contrast pushes the past data to the background while utilizing red to subconsciously signal danger or alertness. The stripes distinguish the data as a projection rather than a recorded fact. Instead of displaying daily or weekly averages, I transformed the y-axis data to represent the sum of weekly cases. Scaling the numbers up allowed me to label the axis in the "Millions." This was an intentional choice as I felt that the word "Millions" carries significantly more weight and shock value than "Thousands.” I added a vertical dashed line to mark the first confirmed Omicron case and a specific data label for the projected peak. Listing the full numerical value at the peak maximizes the shock factor and clearly links the variant's arrival to the resulting surge. To focus the message, some elements were intentionally downplayed. The axes are sparsely labeled to prevent overwhelming the reader. The x-axis features 6-month intervals, only enough to provide temporal grounding. Furthermore, by transforming the data into weekly sums, noisy daily readings are summed to highlight overall trends.

        In my initial critique of the NYT spiral chart, I noted that it was difficult to read quickly. My redesign successfully addresses this by capitalizing on design that allows for System 1 thinking. Viewers can process the height and length of an area chart almost instantaneously. However, in the NYT chart, calculating the area of a spiral requires significantly more cognitive strain. However, this redesign process also revealed the tradeoffs I had to make, as I could not address every critique. A linear timeline makes seasonal comparisons much more difficult than a spiral, which stacks the months next to one another. Additionally, laying out the entire pandemic linearly means the past waves of the virus are more visible, meaning they can still distract the reader from the primary focus on the right side of the graph.
