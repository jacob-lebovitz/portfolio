				Insights about the data/visualization:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>This visualization is showing the 7-day average of new Covid-19 cases starting in 2020 and going to 2022.</li>
				<li>Throughout the year 2020, the 7-day average seems to steadily increase over time, shown in the graph by the wider distance between the red and black line. In the start of 2021, there is a peak, followed by a steady decrease throughout the summer until July. This trough is followed by another mild increase throughout October and December of 2021. In 2022, there is a large peak in the data, which actually seems to be a projection for the next month. </li>
				<li>There seems to be a slight wave pattern in the data, with troughs followed by peaks. Winter months on average have a higher 7-day new case value, with troughs coming more in summer months. </li>
				<li>January 2022 has the largest new case average by far compared to the other data available. </li>
			</ul>

				Design Critique:
			</p>

			<p>
				The spiral graph depicting 7-day new Covid-19 cases communicates a somewhat clear message with the audience, while unnecessarily obstructing information in ineffective encodings. Expressive encodings are heavily used in the structure and design choices of the visualization. Constructing time as a spiral line was a decision of expressive encoding, which somewhat effectively controls how the eye moves about the graph. However, constructing time as a non-linear function and spatial having dates that are temporally far physically close together on the visualization can make it challenging to understand and derive trend insights. The spiral graphic gives an idea of continuity as compared to a static horizontal axis, possibly giving readers the sensation that this spiral will continue and this issue is not terminating. This continuity is reflected in the lack of a border at the end of the red region, emphasizing the perception that Jan. 2022 is just the end of the graph but the area is going to continue to rise. Additionally, encoding the data value as a width was another expressive encoding to show covid cases through an area/length measurement. Effective encoding is not too pronounced, but the placement of the end of the spiral at the top of the page draws your eyes toward January 2022, which also is the widest portion of the graph. Red coloring on the shading connotes negativity for US readers, associating covid case rises with a negative emotional response. The illustrator draws an eye to Jan. 2022 as the highlight of the graphic, disregarding the importance of potential trends in years prior, which was the main point of the article. The data is able to be seen over each year, so it is not necessarily hidden, but manipulating the axis makes it more challenging to understand trends. This decision highlights Jan. 2022 and hides trends, which while not necessarily deceptive, it is important to note. Additionally, the width of the scale going to 150k while Jan. 2022 looks to be larger than that width, making it challenging to gather actual data points from the graph.
				The target audience would be able to gather general trends, but they lack the ability to directly compare between specific dates. However, the typical audience for the New York Times is not interested in grabbing specific data; communicating general trends and highlighting upcoming increases in cases is far more important, which is a strength of the visualization. The audience can clearly see that January 2022 will have the largest new cases, which is the message throughout the piece. Each year is labeled to be at the start of January, and the month dividers are labeled. The width of the line is described to be the 7-day average in new cases, but maybe it is difficult to understand that the black line is an axis. The legend labels 0 and 150k cases, but does not communicate any other length values. The article describes 2022 to be a projection, but that is not labeled or communicated in the visualization. Consistent font sizes and colors make it easy to read dates and establish a hierarchy of importance to the labels. Most people will start reading the graph at the top and move down, only understanding the structure of the spiral after a first glance. This will take them back to the top, which is the key point of the visualization. I wish there was a specific graph title to connect Omicron cases with the cases shown in the graph.
